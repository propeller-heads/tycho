# Protocol Testing

Rust-based integration testing framework for Tycho protocol implementations. See our full
docs [here](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/for-dexs/protocol-integration/3.-testing).

## How to Run Locally

```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running or start it via Docker
docker compose up db -d

# Export necessary env vars
export RPC_URL=..
export SUBSTREAMS_API_TOKEN=..

# If you use a local PostgreSQL instance, set the connection string if necessary
# By default, the binary will use `postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5431/tycho_indexer_0`
# export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres

# Run the tests for a specific package, defined in their integration_test.tycho.yaml file
# This type of tests are constrained to a specific block range defined
cargo run -- range --package "ethereum-balancer-v2"

# To run the full test, that will index from the protocol creation block to the latest:
cargo run -- full --package "ethereum-balancer-v2"

# Run tests on a specific chain. Default is Ethereum.
# Make sure to set the RPC_URL environment variable to match the target network.
cargo run -- range --package "base-aerodrome-slipstreams" --chain base

# Clean up
docker compose down
```

### Running alongside another Tycho stack

The defaults collide with a locally running Tycho stack (Postgres on host port 5431, indexer
on port 4242). Worse, each run drops and recreates the database named in `DATABASE_URL` — so
never point it at a database another instance is using. To run in parallel, isolate all ports:

```bash
# Start a dedicated Postgres on a free host port
DB_HOST_PORT=5433 docker compose up db -d

# Point the test runner at it and pick a free indexer port
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5433/tycho_indexer_0
export TYCHO_SERVER_PORT=4243   # or pass --tycho-server-port 4243

cargo run -- range --package "ethereum-balancer-v2"
```

## Strict mode

A package's `integration_test.tycho.yaml` (and each clone's `integration_test_<clone>.tycho.yaml`)
chooses which checks its tests run:

```yaml
harness: strict
substreams_yaml_path: ./substreams.yaml
# ...
```

- **Legacy** (no `harness` key, the default) runs the checks every existing package was written
  against. Its checks and their pass or fail are unchanged.
- **Strict** is opt-in. It is being built up check by check, and is not required of any package
  yet; the yaml format stays backwards compatible until it is complete.

In strict mode:

- A key the runner does not read is an error that names it, so a misspelt `skip_exectuion` cannot
  pass silently. Legacy mode logs such keys as a warning.
- Every skip is written as its reason, a string. `true` gives no reason and `false` is the
  default, so both are errors naming the flag and the component:

  ```yaml
  skip_execution: "range predates Shanghai; the router needs PUSH0"
  ```

  A reason works in legacy mode too, where `true` and `false` stay valid. A trace, a command and
  its output, or a ticket go in the reason, which the logs and the report show.
- A missing executor deployment is not a reason to skip execution: the harness plants the
  executor's runtime bytecode from `fixtures/`, so execution runs either way.
- Every check of a test runs, and the test fails at the end listing every failed check, instead of
  stopping at the first. A check that needs the result of a failed one is reported as not run.
- New checks are added to strict mode only, so a legacy package never starts failing because the
  harness grew.

### Test report

`range --report <path>` writes every check's outcome, per test, as JSON, in either mode:

```json
{
  "package": "ethereum-foo",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "harness": "strict",
  "results": [
    { "test": "first", "check": "state.components", "outcome": "pass" },
    { "test": "first", "check": "balances", "outcome": "skipped", "reason": "skip_balance_check: true" },
    { "test": "first", "check": "sim.ladder", "outcome": "fail", "detail": "Error calculating amount out ..." },
    { "test": "first", "check": "exec.ladder", "outcome": "not_run", "reason": "sim.ladder failed" }
  ]
}
```

| Check | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `index` | the range indexes, and the snapshot can be read at the stop block |
| `state.components` | every expected component is indexed, with its tokens and static attributes |
| `state.excluded` | no excluded component is indexed |
| `balances` | indexed balances match `balanceOf` on chain |
| `decode` | the snapshot decodes, and so does every expected component |
| `sim.ladder` | limits, spot prices and quotes at 0.1%, 1% and 10% of the limit, every direction |
| `exec.ladder` | executing each quote on chain matches the simulation |

A skipped check is reported with its reason, per component (by lowercase id) for
`skip_simulation` and `skip_execution`. A test-wide `sim.ladder` or `exec.ladder` result covers
only the components without a skip entry for it; when every component skips, the test-wide result
is `skipped`. In legacy mode the report ends at the first failed check of a test.

## How to Run with Docker

```bash
# Export necessary env vars
export RPC_URL=..
export SUBSTREAMS_API_TOKEN=..
export PROTOCOLS="ethereum-balancer-v2=weighted_legacy_creation ethereum-ekubo-v2"

# The test-runner image compiles the EVM adapter against its lib/ submodules, so initialize them
# first
git submodule update --init --recursive ../adapter-integration/evm/lib

# Build both images (test-runner + db) and run the tests. --abort-on-container-exit stops the
# stack when the one-shot test-runner finishes.
docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit

# Clean up
docker compose down
```

By default this runs `range` tests. To run the `full` test (continuous sync from the initial block
to the chain tip) set `MODE=full`. In full mode the optional `=` suffix is the start block
(`--initial-block`). Full mode never exits, so omit `--abort-on-container-exit` and tear down
manually:

```bash
export MODE=full
export PROTOCOLS="ethereum-balancer-v2=12345678"
docker compose up --build
```

## Runtime Bytecode Fixtures

Execution validation overrides the TychoRouterV3, FeeCalculator, and protocol executors at simulation
time with the runtime bytecode in `fixtures/*.runtime.json`. These are generated from the
`tycho-execution` contracts, so they must be regenerated whenever those contracts change.

`crates/tycho-execution/contracts/test/RuntimeBytecodeFixtures.sol` lists every fixture and reads
executor constructor arguments from `crates/tycho-execution/config/executor_deployments.json`.
Executor fixtures deploy at `tycho-test`'s `EXECUTOR_ADDRESS`, where execution validation plants
their code, so immutable self-addresses remain callable. The router and fee calculator use
addresses derived from their contract names. Each fixture has its own fork; an executor forks
its deployment chain at a pinned block, unless its constructor needs state from a different block
on that chain.

```bash
cd ../../crates/tycho-execution/contracts
export RPC_URL=..   # and the other [rpc_endpoints] in foundry.toml, one per chain with a listed executor

# Verify the committed fixtures match the current contracts (forge test runs this in CI)
forge test --match-contract RuntimeBytecodeFixtures

# Regenerate every fixture from the current contracts
forge script script/WriteRuntimeBytecodeFixtures.s.sol
```

The FeeCalculator fixture is a fresh deployment with zero fees, so it is a no-op during simulation
(the router calls it on every swap to read the router fee rate).

`UniswapV4Robinhood.runtime.json` builds like the others, from `(robinhood, uniswap_v4)` on a
Robinhood fork, so `forge test` catches drift if the Robinhood executor changes.
